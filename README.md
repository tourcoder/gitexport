# gitexport

Exporting content that does not contain .git 

### Intro

`gitexport` is a simple bash script to export content that does not contain .git.

Recently, I need to upload a project without a .git file to another place (E.g. Cloudflare Pages), so I wrote this script.

### Install

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/huabin/gitexport/master/gitexport | bash
```

### How to use

Run command in the root directory of the project.

```
Usage: gitexport [OPTION]...
Options:
  -t, --to           Export the files without .git
  -h, --help         Show help information
  -v, --version      Show Gitexport version
  -u, --upgrade      Upgrade Gitexport to latest version
```

The exported content will be generated on your Desktop in a folder named `gitexport`.
